# birth_year = 1992

# This code works, but converting a number to a string every time is not very convenient. For more visual formatting, we can use the string format() method

# We pass the necessary parameters to the format() method, and Python puts them in place of the {} curly braces as placeholders. We can create as many placeholders as we want.

# birth_year = 1992 ðŸ’ ðŸ’ ðŸ’ 
# text = 'My name is Timur, I was born in {}'.format(birth_year)

# print(text)

# birth_year = 1991 ðŸ’ ðŸ’ ðŸ’ 
# name = "Lucio"
# profession = "Math teacher"

# text = "My name is {}, I was born in {}, I work as a {}.".format(
#     name, birth_year, profession
# )

# print(text)

# The format() method does a good job of formatting strings, but if there are a lot of parameters, the code may seem a little redundant.
