# The split() method splits a string into parts using the default whitespace (or a specified delimiter) as the delimiter, and returns a list of those parts. The join() method joins the elements of a list (or string) into a string, using as a delimiter the string on which it is called. If we apply the join() method to a list, then its elements can only be of string data type.
